% `thesaurus.com` provides the synonym `sparkle`, which
% receives an AFINN score of `3`.

% A hard expression to classify. The closest IMHO in
% AFINN is `heartfelt`, which receives a score of `3`.
heart_eyes: 3

% `kiss` receives an AFINN score of `2`. `love` a `3`.
% I'd say `kissing_heart` is most close to `love`, thus I
% gave it a `3`, whereas the other receive a `2` for
% kissing.
kissing_heart: 3
kissing_closed_eyes: 2
kissing: 2
kissing_smiling_eyes: 2

% Stuck out tongues are quite silly. Gemoji tags

% and `stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes` as `prank`.
% `silly` receives an AFINN score of `-1` (and the related
% `foolish` as `-2`). `prank`s related `gag` and `trick`
% both receive a `-2`. But, the closed eyes in
% `stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes` and the normal eyes in
% `stuck_out_tongue` are both quite happy.

% Although `grinning` receives a `2` as seen above,
% the `grin` emoji is also known as `frustrated`,
% `freezing`, and `cold`.
% Rumour has it, Apple created this emoji to look
% as a `grimacing face` by accident, and other vendors
% kept this mistake in place[2].
% Therefore, this emoji is classified as a slightly
% negative `-1`.
% EDIT: Apple has fixed this, and others' have too[3],
% so I’m reclassifying as `2`.

cry: -2

% `joy` receives an AFINN score of `3`.
joy: 3

% `sob`, also known as `loudly crying`, is not in AFINN.
% Due to the superlativeness to the above `cry`, sob

% Not in AFINN, neither is `drool`, `snot`, etc.
% Thus, a neutral `0`.
sleepy: 0

% as `2`. As the face[2] looks quite negative, I

% receiving an AFINN score of `-2`.

confounded: -2

% `laughing` receives an AFINN score of `1`.
laughing: 1

% thesaurus.com gives `fool`, `weirdo` as synonyms, which both have an AFINN
% rating of `-2`. However, this looks quite happy & cute, so I’ll be less
% harsh.
nerd_face: -1

% Quite scary to some people (`fool: -2`), ok for others (comedy, comic: 1),
% so I’ll keep it at `0` (neutral).
clown_face: 0

% vendors seem to put the cowboy hat on `smiley` (which gets a `+2`).
cowboy_hat_face: 2

% As `frowning` gets a `-1` (and I’m not going to add `-0.5`), I’ll give this
% `-1` too. Sure, there’s a difference, but unless both Emoji appear next to
% each other, that difference is subtile.
slightly_frowning_face: -1
frowning_face: -2

% No AFINN matches for this, but it gets confusing appearances across vendors:
